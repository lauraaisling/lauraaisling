### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Laura and I am a PhD candidate in the University of Limerick. My research so far has focused on the security of image classification models. Iâ€™m currently working on detecting adversarial examples for convolutional neural networks. I am more broadly interested in understanding deep learning models and AI safety, in particular the robustness and interpretability of neural networks.
